## Recommendations

I figure that while I have you're attention, I'll write down a list of some of the influential writing and media I've taken note of.
I'm always reading a new book, watching conference talks and indulging in podcasts, so send any recommendations my way!

- Any [Bryan Cantrill talk](http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/2018/02/03/talks/) is awesome
- [How Linux Works](https://nostarch.com/howlinuxworks2) is the book I wish I had 10 years ago
- [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) has been a good guide for me
- [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](https://pragprog.com/titles/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks/) is a good intro for some PL topics
- [Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/code-the-hidden-language-of-computer-hardware-and-software-9780735611313)
