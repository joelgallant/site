## Who am I?

Hey! My name is Joel.

I'm a self-taught software developer in Canada, currently working for [Cruise](getcruise.com) on autonomous vehicles.

A little bit about me, if you care:

[FIRST Robotics](https://www.firstinspires.org/), the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/), Secular Buddhism, travel, and family are all important to me.
I've spent a lot of time teaching and mentoring others, especially in FIRST Robotics (I led and mentored my former team 4334 for a few years).
I tend to be obsessed with a new hobby or new interest at any given time.

I care deeply about the social and political goals of Free Software (FOSS).
Software is a social technology, and users of programs should not be artificially limited in its use.
I've tried to push these goals anywhere I go.

At work, I value craftsmanship and durability.
I deeply believe that creative work needs an "end" - wholly understanding a problem is most of the work of solving it.
This is taken too far without context though - perfectionism isn't the goal.
My work comes down to understanding and helping real human beings.
