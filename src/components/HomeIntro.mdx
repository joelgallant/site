## Who am I?

I'm a curious, life-long learner. I'm self-taught in programming, and have been using code to build things for as long as I can remember.
I'm Canadian, male (he/him), and this is the only place on the internet where you'll find much from me ([delete ](https://www.privacytools.io/)[Facebook](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/privacy-respecting)).

In particular, I care deeply about the social and political goals of Free Software (FOSS).
The Linux community enabled me to learn and grow, in many ways that would have been inaccessible to me.
I try to encourage this philosophy and openness anywhere I go.

Some of the most important things in my life have been [FIRST Robotics](https://www.firstinspires.org/), the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/), Financial Independence, Secular Buddhism, travel, and family.
I've spent a lot of time teaching others, especially with FIRST Robotics.
I tend to be obsessed with something at any given time - at the moment it's Formula 1 racing.

In work, I value craftsmanship and durability.
I deeply believe that creative work needs an "end" - understanding a problem is most of the work in solving it.
This can be taken too far without context though - perfectionism without reasoning is just wasting time.
My work comes down to understanding and helping actual human beings.
