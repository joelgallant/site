## Skills

I tend to be very flexible in my technical skills.
Generally, I've been a "web developer" - meaning that I've worked on a lot of CRUD back office web apps.
This is more descriptive than it is prescriptive though - I've had the opportunity to work on a lot more than that.

I'm a polyglot, and always looking to learn another language.
Lately, my projects are written in TypeScript and Rust.
The first language I learnt was Java, and I've been influenced by Ruby, Python, C++, Swift and Go.

The fanciest things I've worked on have been embedded realtime computer vision on a quadcopter, a payroll rule-based scheduling algorithm, interactive photoshop-esque user interfaces, and many REST backends.
I really like plumbing and scaffolding more than the average developer, and tend to help with devops as well.
Boring isn't bad, and I try to spend the majority of my time on improvement, not just "new" stuff.

For web UIs, I use React for most tasks nowadays (though Vue and Svelte interest me).
My general approach is to build the data architecture before worrying about presentation layer.
Libraries like [mobx-state-tree](https://mobx-state-tree.js.org) make a ton of sense to me.

For CRUD/REST applications, I'm most comfortable with Node.js, an ORM (I like [Objection.js](https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/)), and PostgreSQL databases.
I've built complex systems with gRPC, WebSockets, and dabbled with GraphQL.
Problems that shouldn't be solved with a relational database, in my experience, are few and far between.

I was well positioned to learn management and leadership skills as well.
I've led small teams, taught many juniors and high-school students CS fundamentals, and have led hiring for my employers.
I'm interested in continuing this trajectory, and intend to build a business one day.
I've also been involved in writing grant applications and 2 patents.

Otherwise, my work with FIRST Robotics has given me the opportunity to work with Solidworks (CAD) and 3D printing quite a bit.
Along these lines, electronics are a hobby of mine (I like [Ben Eater](https://eater.net/)'s projects).

I'm proud to have built Open Source projects while I was at [Launchcode](https://lc.dev/) - [app-config](https://github.com/launchcodedev/app-config) and [router](https://github.com/launchcodedev/router) were the bigger two.
I continue to work on these in my spare time.
